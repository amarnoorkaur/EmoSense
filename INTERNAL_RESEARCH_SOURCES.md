## 🔬 Methodology & Research Design

### Why Synthetic Data?

1. **No Real Studies Available**: There are no publicly available market research papers that map specific emotions (28 GoEmotions labels) to business actions with precise metrics.

2. **Demonstration Purpose**: These documents are designed to show HOW the RAG system works, not to provide medical-grade accuracy.

3. **Industry Patterns**: The numbers are based on real-world patterns observed in:
   - Social media marketing case studies
   - Customer service benchmarks
   - Viral content analysis
   - Emotional marketing research

4. **Realistic Ranges**: All metrics fall within plausible ranges based on publicly available industry reports (e.g., HubSpot, Sprout Social, Hootsuite annual reports).

### Data Construction Process:

```
Step 1: Identify emotion categories (positive, negative, neutral)
Step 2: Research common business scenarios for each emotion
Step 3: Synthesize metrics from industry benchmarks
Step 4: Create actionable recommendations
Step 5: Format as research papers with sources
```

### Validation Approach:

- ✅ Numbers are **plausible** (not extraordinary claims)
- ✅ Recommendations are **actionable** (real business actions)
- ✅ Patterns are **consistent** across documents
- ✅ Insights are **generalizable** (not product-specific)
